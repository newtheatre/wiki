# Fire Alarm 

For the use of smoke and haze effects the fire detection system in the theatre must be isolated. The SM must check this before the show. The action of isolating the fire alarm must only be carried out by an authorised member of committee (typically, this will be someone on Front of House).

As of 2019, the University Estates team have decided we are **not permitted** to turn the fire alarm off. This means we are not permitted to use smoke or haze in the building until this is rectified. The Union H&S team are behind us to try and make this happen.

These guides exist as a reference until that time!

# Haze Machine

We have a Look Solutions Unique 2.1 Hazer. 
This is a 2-channel DMX hazer and can fill the auditorium in about 10 minutes (depending on settings). 

Once powered on, the machine takes a few minutes to warm up before it will output haze.

One thing to note is that the fan on full is quite loud for a theatre setting.

From experience, setting the fan to 15% and haze to 7-10% will give you a good misty stage. 

**Make sure there is fluid in the machine before use**

## Powering Off

When you are finished using the hazer, there are two methods of powering off, you can press the menu button repeatedly until the word 'OFF' shows on screen. Then press enter. The machine will run its power down sequence, then you can turn the power off. The other method is simply to remove the dmx cable from the back of the machine, this will automatically run the power down sequence, allowing you to turn the power off.  This keeps it nice and clean and will help it last for years to come!

# Smoke Machine 

We have a Martin Magnum 650 Smoke Machine.
This is a manually operated smoke machine which requires a wired remote to use. Typically this would be operated by a stage manager in the wings on certain cues.

The machine takes about 10 minutes to be able to output smoke. The remote has a red light, once this turns on it indicates the machine is ready.
There is only one smoke level, all or nothing, but creates powerful jets of smoke which can be effective.

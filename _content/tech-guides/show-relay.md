The Show Relay refers to the system that provides an audio and video feed of the Auditorium stage to other areas of the building, including tech box, stage right wing, and dressing room. Used in conjunction with comms, this gives people who aren't in the auditorium a good idea of what's happening on stage.

# Powering On

1. Turn on the camera (rigged outside tech box, powered inside tech box)
Switch (labeled ‘Camera’) is on the same side as the light switches in the Tech Box

2. Turn on screen for feed in Tech Box
Power switch on the Tech Box wall
Power button bottom right of screen

3. Turn on the 13 amp switch in SR wing labeled ‘SR Power’
(This will also turn on the blues in the wing)
Power button bottom right of screen in SR wing

4. Check there is sound coming through to the dressing room
> **Hint:** This requires the sound desk and amp rack to be on, and the base sound file loaded 

5. Turn the TV in the dressing room on
> **Hint:** If you get a blue or black screen, try different inputs until you get the correct one (‘CAM’)

# Seeing in the Dark
One of the bonuses of a show relay system is to help see when a transition in a blackout has completed.

There is an IR light (usually rigged on LX1, above the auditorium seats) which the camera picks up allowing us to see in the dark.

This needs to be plugged into hard power, typically through a 13-15A adapter and then patching it into hard power in the Workshop.

Once patched and the rig powered on, it will turn on automatically. There is no on/off switch.

In the technical department, we use headsets to talk to each other across the building. These are called comms or cans, and used across the theatre industry internationally. 

When using the headsets for show communication there are certain phrases and procedures we use to ensure clarity and prevent miscommunications. These are fairly standard across the entire industry so taking the time to learn them is very valuable.

# The Kit 

A set of comms comes in two parts: the headset, and the beltpack.

## Headset 
These have your microphone and a single earpiece to allow you to hear ambient sound. Try to position the mic so that it sits in front of your chin rather than directly in front of your mouth, this reduces how much of your breathing it will pick up.

## Belt Pack

Your headset plugs into this pack, which is in turn connected via standard XLR cable to all other headsets in the system. Many of these packs look slightly different but they have the same basic functions. 

### Mic Button
This button is pressed in until it clicks to activate, many of them also turn green to indicate the mic is live. The mic will then stay on until you press the button again. Some of the packs have a Push To Talk (PTT) button, which only turns the mic on while you're holding it.

### Volume Dial
This controls the volume of any audio coming through your headset.

### Signal / Call Button
This is used to attract attention from other headset wearers. Most commonly if you need to attract the attention of someone who has taken their headset off for whatever reason (often a sound person is busy listening to the show!). Pressing the button will illuminate the same button on everyone's belt pack.

# Procedure

Throughout a performance, all operators, DSM, and SM should all be on comms. "On comms" referring to having their headset on and being able to hear.

## Calls 
The DSM will typically call a show in the following manner: 

1. DSM gives standby to operators
2. Operators confirm standby
3. If backstage is not ready the SM should make it known at this point.
4. DSM gives 'GO'.

# Comms Etiquette 
The following things are good practice and give clarity to everyone else on comms, avoiding waiting around and frustration.
* [Name] On / Off cans 
Announcing when you're taking your headset off and when you're back is greatly important and aid the rapid relay of information across departments. 
* Comms check 
Each comms user should do a quick announcement and check when they arrive at the beginning of the day to make sure everything is working and at an appropriate volume.
* Leaving your mic on
It is up to you whether you leave your mic on when you're not speaking. People who need their hands a lot and can't press the button (eg stage managers turning pages) will often keep theirs on, whereas others will turn it off.
Please turn the mic off if you need to drink, cough, etc. No one wants to hear a sneeze or a chew very loudly in their ear.
* Why bother?
Although many of the people working on the show are in the tech box together, using comms provides clarity and amplification, as well as being able to guarantee you can hear any calls from the stage for whatever reason.
* Standby acknowledgement  
A DSM will often call cue standbys, and may prefer you to acknowledge that you have heard the standby and are ready to perform the cue. Do clarify with the SM whether they would like acknowledgements, and acknowledge in the order standbys were given (eg if the call is 'Standby LX7, SFX 8' then the sound operator should acknowledge first).

When a standby is called, all comms should be silent until the ‘go’ is called or the standby is dismissed. 

# Do's and Don'ts

| Instead of | Do this | Why? |
| "Standby for 3 go's" | "Standby for 3 cues" / "Standby for 3 gee-ohs" / "Standby LX 10 thru 13" 	| Saying "go" at any time other than when you want a cue to fire can result in a misfire if someone only hears the 'go'. Saying "Gee-Oh" (G-O) can also make it clear you don't mean "Go".
| "Standby Cue 7" | "Standby LX 7" | Always specify the department that you're standing by - there may be a sound and lighting cue 7!
| "Standby LX" | "Standby LX 4" | Always specify a cue number so that you and the department can ensure you're in the same place

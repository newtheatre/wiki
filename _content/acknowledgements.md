Most of the content you see on here has been taken from the old NNT members' page and various other resources made by alumni, which in turn was taken from more official guidance such as the EOS Tea Break Tutorials or created entirely new from the brains of some amazing people. These pages have now vanished, with the old NNT members page being an archive.

Nevertheless, I would like to give credit where credit is due. A massive thank you to anyone at the NNT who had the brilliant idea to write stuff down. Without them, most of the content on this website wouldn't exist, neither would any of the other websites, and I personally would be struggling a lot more with teaching new members things that I just wouldn't know.

Special thanks to Sam Osborne & Will Pimblett and everyone else working behind the scenes to keep the tech and websites working. Even though you guys were here before my time and may not even know this website exists, you have been instrumental to the creation and function of it. I mean it when I say that this website genuinely wouldn't exist without you.

Thank you, for everything.
Ellie Sugden, Company Technical Director 2022/23

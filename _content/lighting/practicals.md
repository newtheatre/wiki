title: Practicals
---

In a theatrical sense, the term 'Practical' refers to any item of set, props or lighting which must work as it would in the real world, for example: a bedside table light; or a lightbulb in a lampshade to signify the normal room light.

The NNT has a variety of different practicals available for use, including lampholders on a long cable that can be hung from the rig and used with any lampshade you want. Most of these can be used as you would any other light in the rig, and those designated for use as on stage practicals should have a 15A plug wired onto them, but if not you can easily adapt to 13A. There are however a few types of practical that behave a little differently, and are outlined below.

## Desk Lamps
Most of these will be relatively straightforward as they are normally a filament lightbulb so will behave as any normal theatrical light would, however if there is a switch between the plug and the light then make sure this is somehow rigged to be permanently on (unless the phyiscal switching is required in the show) but most times the physical switching cab be replicated by a snap on and off cue called as a visual.

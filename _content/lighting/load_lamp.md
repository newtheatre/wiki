title: Load Lamps
---

A Load Lamp is used when the intended stage light does not behave as it should when dimmed, this is due to certain electrical circumstances that are outlined below if you would like to know.

For NNT, the most common lights that would need a load lamp are the FLourescent Tubes, the Auditorium side lighting and ? (Help Please Sam.)

For most of these, you can plug the load lamp (most commonly an old acclaim or 650w Fresnel) into the second socket of the dimmer in the workshop, this is useful as you don't have to worry about pointing the load lamp where the light will not spill onto stage.

If you need to use a load lamp with the Smartpack, then you will need to plug the load lamp into the same socket that you've plugged the fixture requiring load into, this is because the dimming inside the smartpack is circuit specific, even if you've got both socapex outs programmed to be channels 1-6, each socaped out is fed from a different bank of dimmers.

And now, as promised, the electrical bit.

## Why do we need Load Lamps?

Standard theatrical dimmer are designed for a 'resistive' load, where the electricity flows directly through the item that creates the light, eg. the filament in a filament lamp.

Some Practical lighting nowadays are run through transformers, where the electrical load is not directly fed through the part of the circuit that creates the light. These are known as 'inductive' loads. Most standard theatrical dimmers internal electronics are not designed to deal with inductive loads, and so the dimming would come out juddery, or the light would not start dimming until the channel was at 15-20%, and would then 'snap' on to a low level.

The addition of a load lamp to these circuits allows the dimmer's internal electronics to function correctly, and allows the inductive loads to dim as a resistive load would.

The other reason we would need a load lamp is that then the channel is at 0%, the connected light does not fully turn off (Like the Auditorium side lights). this is also due to the lights being an inductive load, but the low wattage of the light means that the general 'current leakage' of a dimmer is enough to keep the lights on. the addition of a load lamp increases the resistance around the circuit and this leakage is reduced to a level where the light does not turn on when the channel is set at 0%.

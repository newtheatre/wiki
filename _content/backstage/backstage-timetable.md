Below is a quick run through of the backstage process at the NNT! Each play will vary in terms of when and how meetings etc are run. This quick guide should give you an idea of what everything is, what will happen, and what you have to do!

# Backstage Vision Meeting

**No Stress, Just a Casual Chat!**

* Chance to get to know everyone on the backstage team
* Make sure to find the best way to communicate with them
* Have fun, bounce ideas off each other
* Just read through script beforehand and come with some ideas of things you would like to do

**Coordinate**
* See if your ideas match up with other people’s 
* How can certain themes be highlighted? May take all of backstage
* Work together! Collaborate! 
_Eg. a lighting and sound sequence synchronized, a mirror in the set to bounce a light off, a really noisy prop matching a sound effect_

# Logistics Meeting
**Prepare for the Get-In:**
* What equipment from the NNT will you need?
* What equipment will we need to hire in?
* Do we need to buy anything?
* Do we have everything ready for show week?

**Check In:**
* Are you feeling confident about what you need to do over the next two weeks?
* Do you need any further assistance in the next few weeks?
* Are there any welfare concerns?
* Do you have any questions related to the get in or show week?

# Preliminary Meeting
**Up to the Tech Box Team to arrange! It's a DSM Meeting so is less applicable to, but can still be useful for Studio!**
* LD, SD & DSM meet a couple of days before cue-to-cue
* Tell each other all the cues you have, make sure they all line up
* Chance to work out tight cues with other techies, do you want to MIDI any cues?
* Just the tech team and DSM need to be there – arrange among yourselves
* Also a chance to coordinate tech box snacks with each other

# Get-Ins
> In House: Saturday Night | Studio: Thursday Evening

## What happens?

A get in happens on the before your show, and is the point where you set up all lights, speakers, set, props etc.

**For In House:**
This happens after the final show of the previous slot, about 10pm.

You will get out the previous show, then get in your show.

## Order of events:
* We are transforming the space into the show in one go: Set, Tech, Props etc.
* Starts with a briefing of what jobs need to be done, in what order, by whom.
* If you finish your job, ask someone what else you can help with.
* Normally, we work until everything is done.

* For in House:
	* Happens after the final show of the previous slot, generally your team will go to this show.
	* Tech has priority, they will set up and go home.
	* Tech desk must be moved down to seats.
	* Wallpapering, painting & floorboards generally take the most time – try to get this done in advance

## Remember:
* This is the first time you need insurance. If you don't have a membership, buy one before you do anything.
* Do not turn up drunk or high. We will send you home. Just don't. It's not worth it
* If you're not ladder or rig trained, tell us at the start. It takes 5 mins and means you're safe
* Bring food and water. Make sure you have coffee and/or sugar when you need it
* Don't be scared to tell us if you break something. It is fine, things break. We've all broken stuff

# Lighting Focussing & Sound Levelling
> In House: Sunday Morning | Studio: Friday Evening

## What happens?
* The lighting designer points the lights to the correct place, focuses them and moves barn doors. Then runs through the light cues and makes sure they all look right
* Sound designer runs through the sound effects/songs making sure they are the correct volume and playing from correct speaker

## Order of events:
* Patch all lights and make sure they are working, make sure sounds have imported correctly.
* Run through your entire cue list and make sure the director is happy with all the lights and sounds.

## Remember:
* Director, Producer, hopefully SM or DSM should also be there to help
* Director will know what they want, where actors will be, how loud something should be, ask their opinion if unsure.

# Cue-to-Cue
> In House: Sunday Afternoon | Studio: Friday Evening

## What happens?
* DSM, LD & SD run through every cue with actors to make sure everyone is happy
* Focus on things such as spotlights at the right place/height and visual cues (like actor pretending to turn on a radio)
* Movers, blackouts and scene changes also key

## Order of events:
* Happens after programming
* Running through the cues, stopping whenever they need to make a change to a cue
* This is the LD & SD's time; they will tell the actors to stop or rewind whenever they need to
* Typically, will run through whole play beginning to end.

## Remember:
* Director to guide them, ask the director's opinion if unsure.
* This is a very high stress time everyone – that does not excuse poor behaviour! If people are mean to you, please seek welfare help!
* Don’t be afraid to run through same cue multiple times if unsure, this is your best chance to get it right
* Ask director to write down notes and give them to you later

# Tech Run
> In House: Monday Evening | Studio: Friday Evening

## What happens?
* IDEALLY: It is a full run through without stops to make sure that all the tech works.
* ACTUALLY: It is a full run through with some stops to sort out tech stuff.
* Your director should be taking notes for tech of tweaks and things to look out for. They will tell you this at the end.


## Order of events:
* Run through the show trying not to stop.
* You can stop, but if it's only minor tweaks you are better sorting them out afterwards

## Remember:
* Don't miss you lectures for theatre. You will regret it. Don't play catch-up. It's not worth it.
* If you need a break, tell your SM. If people are being shitty, tell your SM.
* If tech goes wrong, help is one message away. We will come running
* Suggest ordering food 40 mins before you think the interval/break will be

_(For In House: At the end move the tech desk back to the tech box ready for dress run.)_

# Dress Run
> In House: Tuesday Evening | Studio: Saturday

## What happens?
* Another full run through of the show, mostly for the actors – ideally smooth (unlikely)
* Another chance to iron out any problems in tech
* Take notes for yourself, no one else will be paying attention to tech
* Make small tweaks

## Order of events:
* Get comfortable in the tech area, your home for the next few days
* Run through the play without stopping – really really shouldn't be stopping at this point

## Remember:
* Last chance to make changes/spot problems before the audience get in
* Director may have notes for you, but also just make your own
* Make sure everything is at you want it
* We suggest bringing a mug and snacks. Makes all the difference

# Show Days
> In House Wednesday–Saturday | Studio: Sunday–Tuesday

**SM, DSM, ASM, LD & SD:**
* Call time about 6-6:30pm (1-1:30pm for Matinee)

**Get everything set up:**
* Techies turn everything on and make sure everything is working
* SM check the cast and crew are all present and okay
* DSM check the book is still there and there are no changes to cues
* ASM check all the props are set

# Get Out
> In House: Saturday Night | Studio: Tuesday Night

## What happens?
* A Get Out happens immediately after your final show
* You will get out your show _(For In House: You will often help get in the next show)_

## Order of events:
* After the show, your team (and for In House the next slot's team) will sit in the theatre and be given a briefing about what needs to be done, in what order, by whom.
* If you finish your job, ask someone what else you can help with.
* Normally, we work until everything is done.
* It is the opposite to a get in, everything is removed from the space.

✨ Then after party! ✨

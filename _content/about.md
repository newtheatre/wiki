title: About the Wiki
--- 

This wiki is designed to be a tool for information for members of the NNT at any stage in their journey, with the 3 aims:
* Easy to browse
* Easy to read 
* Easy to maintain

You can use the site to serve as a reminder on how to do things, or how things work, or just a bit of reassurance that you're on the right track. Some parts of making theatre are difficult, and it's important to acknowledge that! 

The wiki aims not to replace training sessions, and for the higher-risk activities, training is still essential. But getting stuck on patching DMX? Can't remember the right purple from the logo? You're in the right place. 

## What you can find 
* How to put on a show 
* Building-specific guides (using the infrastructure, the specific equipment,
* How to make your life easier in whatever role you take 
* Descriptions of each performance space, the different departments, and the roles you can take

We're big believers in accessibility, and that although there are lot of moving parts, putting on a show should still be really fun. You don't need to learn everything from scratch, and we've worked out a lot of ways of doing things that can help make it easier.

## What isn't here
Some of the software we use in tech is constantly evolving with time, so we don't aim to reproduce the manuals here and instead link to their extensive, really helpful documentation. Where such documentation doesn't exist, or isn't of the high quality we strive for, we'll write some up.


## How you can help

If you can put something in a way that's easier to understand, find a new way of working you'd like to share, or think something's fallen out of date, please help us out! This wiki is for everyone.

Want to make a change? Please email <wiki@newtheatre.org.uk> or get in touch with a committee member and we can get it updated.
